<p><b>GeoMakers is a community</b> of people that are interesting in creating new ideas and learning about how we can make things in the context of location. Openness, sharing, and trust are foundational values for this community. We want to work together to explore new concepts together. In that spirit, we have some rules to guide us all.</p>
<p><b>Don’t spam</b></br>This includes sending unsolicited @’s on Twitter, marketing 3rd party services, and other spamming tactics. The GeoMakers site is here so people can share ideas and communicate with each other, encourage each other, and learn.</p>
<p><b>Be respectful</b></br>We're all here to share ideas and learn. Remember that the goals of GeoMakers include involving kids in the fun too. Don’t slam other people’s ideas, mock people, or get nasty. If someone has a question, it's their right to ask it and learn from the community. Obscene or hateful language or images will not be tolerated. Don't post personal information. Don't post copyrighted information, images, or files without the permission of the owner. Give proper credit. Most ideas build on other ideas. It's great to see where the impetus for ideas came from and who has contributed. If you don’t like an idea or a project, simply move along and respect our community’s shared space.</p>
<p><b>If you see something, say something</b></br>If you see activity that isn't in line with the community's values, then let us know. If you see something posted that is unsafe, then let definitely speak up. We don’t want to see anything promoted here that is unsafe or illegal. Sometimes it just takes a friendly email or a warning. Sometimes it means taking action to revoke a user's privileges.</p>
<p>Our community will grow and evolve, and so will the community's norms and rules. Thanks for joining and us and we hope you’ll help to make this a strong and safe adventure for everyone.</p>
